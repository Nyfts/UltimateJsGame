## Scoreboard

There is a simple API developed in .NET core for the score system, named ScoreJs.API, and has its own repository in https://github.com/Nyfts/ScoreJs.API.

You can run this local server by openning the file ".\ScoreJs.API\startServer.bat"  
or using the command shell
```
cd .\ScoreJs.API\
dotnet run
```
You must have dotnet core version 3.1.101 or superior to run the server
